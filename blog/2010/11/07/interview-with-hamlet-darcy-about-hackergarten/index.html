<div class="entry-content"><p>Earlier this year I happened upon a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/hackergarten/browse_thread/thread/b4d8dec0e301fff8">post</a> on Google Groups which talked about a group of people getting together to do some coding. They referred to the group as Hackergarten and I&#8217;ve kept tabs of them ever since. I really thought it was interesting that they kept meeting and kept churning out code. Recently I had the opportunity to &#8220;interview&#8221; <a href="http://hamletdarcy.blogspot.com/">Hamlet D&#8217;Arcy</a>, the founder of Hackergarten,</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What is Hackergarten and how did it get started?</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://hackergarten.net/">Hackergarten</a> is a different type of user group. Our goal is to meet once a month and create something of value for the software development community. So far this year we&#8217;ve contributed a lot: the Gradle Announce and IntelliJ IDEA plugins, the new <a href="http://canoo.com/blog/2010/09/20/log-groovys-new-and-extensible-logging-conveniences/">@Log annotation</a> in Groovy 1.8 , at least six or seven Griffon plugins, over 10 CodeNarc static analysis rules, and some other stuff too. Now that I list it all out, it seems like quite a nice contribution. This is very different than a user group that meets once of month to hear a presentation. Hackergarten is open to anyone, and Canoo has been a great sponsor, never complaining once about the rising pizza and beer costs. We meet regularly in Basel Switzerland, where Canoo is headquartered, but have also done events at the last <a href="http://gr8conf.org/">GR8</a> and <a href="http://jazoon.com/">Jazoon</a> conferences. It depends where we are and how much energy we have to organize things.</p></blockquote></li>
<li><p>How did it get started? What was the inspiration?</p>

<blockquote><p>I lived in Minneapolis for almost 10 years and it has one of the best user group communities in the world. Groovy.MN, Ruby Users of MN, OTUG, and many, many more including Minnebar the largest Bar Camp in the world. It has a real do-it-yourself ethos that I believe is a cultural holdover from the mythical punk scene of the 1980s. You&#8217;re either in a band or making a zine or letting people crash on your coach, but nobody is just showing up to shows and then going home. Likewise in the tech scene, you&#8217;re either presenting at user groups, running a mail server, or writing your own language but nobody is just showing up for the meetings. Of course, almost none of us are old enough to have seen the Replacement or Hüsker Dü live, but local radio has done a tremendous job romanticizing an era that possibly never existed. There is a real drive in Minnesota to make it both the best tech scene between the coasts and a more interesting place than it was in the 1980s.
In contrast, Switzerland and Germany seem very different. Everything is so formal and the user groups seem more concerned with professional quality speakers and making sure they provide an educational service. I wanted something local, something different, and something fun. Right now we&#8217;re focused on code contributions and pushing projects we&#8217;d like to see more popular, such as Groovy, Gradle, and Griffon. But I&#8217;d like to see the group take on more evangelism outside of code. For instance, creating educational material like quick reference cards and screencasts, and even creating conference presentations together. The short term goal is to have a positive impact on the community. Long term, I&#8217;d like to see more unique ideas discussed and implemented instead of focusing on incremental improvements. If you want to be inspired read up on the Vienna Circle. It was basically a group of smart guys that got together regularly to discuss their work and they ended up having an immense effect on philosophy for 100 years. Well, why not us, why not now? I think we&#8217;re getting there slowly but obviously have a long way to go.</p></blockquote></li>
<li><p>Who were the &#8220;key&#8221; people behind getting it started (other than you)? How did you get sponsored?</p>

<blockquote><p>It was mostly my idea but I don&#8217;t like to do things alone so I wrangled my friends Etienne Studer and Johannes Bueler into helping organize. But the real credit goes to the people brave enough to show up. Canoo sponsors us by giving us meeting space and, for many of us, a day job. Canoo has a products that we sell, most notably RIA Suite, but most of us are project consultants. I work on Java or Groovy projects and change clients every 3 to 6 months. Consultants and contractors are always pressured into getting certifications to prove their worth and you can sometimes spend up to 150 hours a year chasing these certs. It&#8217;s big business and they exist to make money; that it makes you more marketable is only a side effect. Why not throw the whole system out and base everything on open source contributions. Know what&#8217;s better than a Sun Certified Java Developer? How about an Open JDK Contributor? I&#8217;d hire the latter much sooner than the SCJD. I&#8217;ve blogged about this in the <a href="http://canoo.com/blog/2010/06/09/it-certification-alternatives-cost-benefit-analysis/">past</a>, and this is our way of putting our money where our mouth is.</p></blockquote></li>
<li><p>How are topics/ideas chosen? Are they generally around java/groovy/JVM technologies/languages?</p>

<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ll read between the lines here and assume the real question is &#8220;How do I organize my own Hackergarten?&#8221; Good question! We&#8217;ve tried a bunch of formats and I&#8217;m not sure there is one size fits all. It all depends on who shows up. I highly recommend picking a project with a plugin system. They are typically well-documented, easy to get started with, and made to be extensible. Gradle, Grails, Griffon, and CodeNarc are all super easy to write plugins for. Also, I recommend picking a topic that at least someone is quite good at. If you don&#8217;t have an expert in the room then you can get caught up on small problems. Our topics have been Groovy related because Dierk Koenig (Groovy in Action) and Andres Almiray (Griffon Lead) both work at Canoo. Lastly, no project is too small. Staying until 2 am is fun once but only once. And it&#8217;s better to release two small pieces of work than get one larger piece half done. That&#8217;s good advice for your day job as well. Lastly, we always pair program. No one works alone. If you&#8217;re keen to work alone then why not just stay home by yourself?</p></blockquote></li>
<li><p>What do people need to do to prepare for a session?</p>

<blockquote><p>People should come with subversion, git, ant, maven, and IntelliJ IDEA installed, and should probably download and build the source code of the project beforehand. Ubuntu is a huge win in this area because it is literally one standard single-line command to install each of them.</p></blockquote></li>
<li><p>How do you find time for Hackgarten?</p>

<blockquote><p>I have no idea. Where do I find time for anything?</p></blockquote></li>
<li><p>Any other suggestions for people on how to get started with a Hackgarten-inspired group of their own?</p>

<blockquote><p>If your group has a budget and wants a visitor then I&#8217;m available! Otherwise, don&#8217;t be afraid to email project leads and ask them to deliver a short webinar and be on call for the session. If anyone wants to do a CodeNarc night then I&#8217;d gladly skype in for a 30 minute demo and remain on call for code reviews and version control commits. And I am sure that you could talk someone from Griffon or Gradle into doing the same. The most rewarding part of working on open source software is seeing someone else submit a patch to a project you work on. <strong>So go make someone&#8217;s day already!</strong></p></blockquote></li>
</ol>


<p>Well that certainly has me inspired, in fact, several friends and co-workers (past and present) have started meeting in the <a href="http://seanp33.wordpress.com/2010/09/27/code-club/">spirit of a book club</a>. We&#8217;ve named it <a href="http://c0d3club.com">c0d3club</a> (<a href="http://c0d3club.com/blog/">blog</a>). We&#8217;re currently considering moving into the direction of Hackergarten, where we&#8217;ll work on code together..since we are software developers.</p>

<p>Thanks again Hamlet!</p>
